# 03 JavaScript: Password Generator

## Description

Building this project taught me a lot about JavaScript and the different fundamentals in and how to use them. I learned a lot about functions and how they work and how to place them correctly with in the JavaScript. They can be very frustrating at times. It was a  difficult section to learn. Variables was fun to learn. Learning the difference between var and let and when to use each one. How to make arrays and the different ways to make them. The list goes on, but i did enjoy this section even know it was more difficult to understand, but it did start clicking after a while of studying it.
